    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <p>I am a Psychology graduate from the University of Texas at Austin with a minor in Business. My research interests include neuroscience, psychology, and decision-making processes, with a focus on integrating low-level vision, affective computation, and probabilistic modeling.</p>
    
    <p>I'm particularly interested in designing experimental tasks that elicit cognitive processes amenable to probabilistic modeling, aiming to develop comprehensive models that span from neural activity to observable behavior in visual perception, emotion, and decision-making.</p>
