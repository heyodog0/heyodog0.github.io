    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <p>I was a recent psychology graduate from UT Austin who currently work as a macaque wet-lab technician at Gorislab and as a remote RA for a grad student @ MIT. </p>

    <p>I am now a PhD student in psychology at Harvard University working with Sam Gershman. </p>

    <p>I am also an aspiring cognitive scientist who wants to build computational models about how people reason about the world. I am particularly interested in creating experimental tasks that are more generalizable and engaging and want to bridge my interests from my interdisciplinary experience in a low-level and high-level cognition.  </p>

    <p>I believe that video games and model-based reinforcement learning are the best way to capture higher-level cognition and want to create experimental tasks akin to these video-game-like scenarios to capture the latent processes of learning. </p>

    <p>Moreover, I want to explore how people learn how to learn, and how that trajectory of learning changes across your lifespan. Babies are so smart, given the amount of information they receive. How do these learning mechanisms come to be? And how do they evolve? </p>

    <p>I want to think and approach problems like a computational systems neuroscientist, but want to explore problems that are more aligned with higher-level cognition (e.g. thinking, learning, etc).  </p>
